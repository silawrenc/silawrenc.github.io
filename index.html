      <p>
        At NearForm I delivered digital products and consulting to a range of
        clients, as well as working on open source initiatives. During my time
        at NearForm I worked in sectors including telecommuncations,
        pharmaceuticals, banking, VR, agriculture, corporate finance, and the
        public sector and with organisations varying from multinationals to
        early-stage startups.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a Delivery Architect my role centred on leading small,
        interdisciplinary teams of senior developers, designers, and platform
        engineers to deliver functional, architectural, or process improvements
        for clients. Responsibilities varied from project to project, but
        covered solution architecture; product definition; significant hands-on
        development work across the stack; liason with client stakeholders and
        developers; agile process management.

      </h3>

      <p>
        At IntelliSense I was responsible for delivering a sophisticated
        modelling and optimisation platform to the mining industry, leveraging
        machine learning and physical modelling techniques in a microservice
        infrastructure. I also introduced agile methodologies to the company and
        lead the main tech team scrum.

        During 2016 I took time out to cycle, hike, and kayak through Europe,
        Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Australia, before moving to Barcelona.

      </h3>
      <p>
        At Graze I worked across the stack including contributed significantly
        to the devolution of the first microservice, and eventually took over as
        de facto lead developer on this service.
      </p>

      <p>
        After just over a year I was promoted to Web Technical Architect, with
        technical responsibility for the web product. In this role I drove
        forward projects to revamp the web architecture, including: rolling out
        a modern front-end framework; pushing for BDD and better testing;
        significantly improving app performance; introducing up-to-date
        technologies for routing and templating.

      </h3>
      <p>
        I took an unpaid position with a start-up building a forum SaaS product
        alongside the two founders. I largely worked on building out a web front
        end, but crucially received the opportunity to learn first hand from two
        exceptional lead developers.

        In 2012, I worked in Greece as a windsurfing and sailing instructor, and
        spent the following winter teaching myself to code.

      <p>
        I developed and evolved statistical modelling techniques for both
        artwork valuation and market performance metrics in the sector of
        contemporary art which consistently forecasted auction prices more
        accurately than key market players.
