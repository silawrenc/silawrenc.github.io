	<h2>Work</h2>

  <h3>Software engineer &mdash; 2017&ndash;present
    <a href="https://www.intellisense.io">intellisense.io</a></h3>

  <p>
    I currently work as a software engineer and scrum master.
    As the former I am responsible for delivering a sophisticated modelling and optimisation platform to the mining industry, leveraging machine learning and physical modelling techniques within a microservice infrastructure.
    As the latter I am leading the charge in bringing agile methodologies and best practices into a company which has previously relied on more traditional project management techniques.
  </p>
  <aside>
    During 2016 I took time out to cycle, hike, and kayak through Europe, Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Australia,
    before moving to Barcelona.

	<h3>Web technical architect &mdash; 2014&ndash;2015
		  Web developer &mdash; 2013&ndash;2014
    <a href="https://graze.com">graze.com</a></h3>

	<p>
		At graze I rapidly progressed from a relatively inexperienced web developer to become an authoritative voice both within the web team, and more broadly on architecture across the tech platform.
		I worked on everything from modernising and modularising front-end javascript to re-architecting the core web application. I also contributed significantly to the devolution of the first graze microservice&mdash;the product allocation system&mdash;and eventually took over as de facto lead developer on this service.
	</p>

	<p>
		After 13 months I was promoted to web technical architect, with technical responsibility for the web product.
		In this role I drove forward projects to revamp the web architecture, including: rolling out a modern front-end framework; pushing for BDD and better testing; significantly improving app performance (time to first byte and server load); introducing up-to-date technologies for routing and templating.
		My final project at graze was to investigate and road map the separation of the existing monolithic architecture into a service-based architecture. This involved analysing a sprawling codebase powering a host of interacting applications, but also considering the interrelations of the different product teams, and the potential for areas of future business expansion.
	</p>

	<aside>
  During the winter and spring of 2013 I learnt Python (via the Django framework), HTML and CSS, and then PHP and mySQL.

	<h3>Research developer &mdash; Feb&ndash;Apr 2013
    <a href="http://microco.sm">microco.sm</a></h3>
	<p>
		I took an unpaid position with a start-up building a forum platform and as such was the first through the door besides the two founders.
		I was responsible for building an API-driven web application using the Django framework.
		Crucially I received extensive exposure to the process of starting a company, and the opportunity to learn first hand from two talented, senior developers.
	</p>

	<aside>
		In 2012, I spent 5 months working in Greece as a windsurfing and sailing instructor for Mark Warner.
		Prior to this, I spent 10 weeks travelling through the Caribbean.

	<h3>Fine Art Quantitative Analyst &mdash; Apr&ndash;Dec 2011
    Pierce Protocols</h3>

	<p>
		My role was to report on the state and prognosis of the contemporary art market. In order to achieve this, I architected a rich relational database of artworks, owners, exhibitions and sales.
		With this I evolved statistical modelling techniques for artwork valuation and market performance which consistently forecasted auction prices more accurately than key market players.
	</p>

  After graduating in 2010 I worked as a yacht skipper in Croatia, before cycling from Ecuador to Patagonia.

	<h3>Freelance &mdash; 2008&ndash;2013
    Institute of Physics</h3>
  <p>
  	At various times I worked on publishing Supporting Physics Teaching materials online.
  	This involved developing a Lua library for parsing custom TEX-based templates and generating both HTML and PDF editions from unified source material.
