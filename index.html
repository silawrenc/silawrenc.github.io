          We are getting legally married in our local town hall, in

            >Plaça de la Vila de Gràcia</a
          >. All are welcome. There will be a short ceremony in spanish at 6pm
          but guests are asked to arrive half an hour before.
        </p>
        <aside>
          Side note - the organisers have asked us to tell you that you will not
          be able to throw rice! Biodegradable confetti/petals are fine, arroz
          no :) Also, please do not bring firecrackers! (Bride’s request).
        </aside>
        <p>
          After the ceremony, we have reserved an area for drinks in a favourite
          bar from 6:30pm-8:30pm. The bar is called

          and is two minutes&apos; walk from the town hall. There are lots of
          local options for dinner afterwards—we have listed
          <a href="#favourites">some of our favourites below</a>. It's
          definitely worth making a reservation as places fill up fast on a
          Friday night!

        <h4>Saturday 18th June</h4>

        <p>
          On the Saturday we're throwing a party at the

            >Palauet d’Orsà</a
          >. The venue has a lovely garden and terrace, so, weather permitting,
          we are hoping to spend most of the day outside. We will not be having
          a formal sit down meal, but food and drinks will be served throughout
          the evening.

        <p></p>

        <h4>Sunday 19th June</h4>
        <p>
          As lots of you will be travelling back or wanting to explore Barcelona
          at your leisure, we are not arranging anything in particular. We will
          both be around Sunday and Monday, so if you are staying on, let us
          know as we would love to spend more time with you!

        <h3>Useful Info</h3>
        <h4>Getting to the venue</h4>

        <p>
          The Palauet d’Orsà is set in the Collserola, the lovely hills
          surrounding Barcelona. It is accessible by public transport or taxi.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Public transport</dt>
          <dd>
            Take line S1 or S2 from Pl. Catalunya or Gràcia station to Peu del
            Funicular. Make sure you get on the middle of the train as the first
            3 sets of doors do not open at the station (the platform is short!).
            At Peu del Funicular, walk along the platform and turn left at the
            top of the stairs to access the funicular, a cable car that takes
            you up into the hills. Get off the funicular at the top, the station
            is called Vallvidrera Superior. From there, the venue is a 500m walk
            away, but up a steepish hill. We would recommend this as a fun way
            to get to the venue, as long as you don’t mind a bit of a climb the
            other end! The S1/S2 lines and funicular both run until 2am (last
            connection leaves Vallvidrera Superior at 1:46am). You can buy
            tickets from the ticket machines in the metro station. Children
            under 4 do not need a ticket for public transport. If you'll be
            using public transport during the weekend it will likely be worth
            buying a

          </dd>

          <dt>Taxi</dt>
          <dd>
            A taxi to the venue will cost around €15-20. They will be easy to
            hail from the city centre. There are plenty of apps you can use to
            book/hail taxis, including Freenow and Cabify. Children do not need
            a child seat for taxis in the city. You can prebook a taxi with
            child seats 24 hours in advance by calling:
            <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://radiotaxi033.com/"
              >RadioTaxi033</a
            >. Although they should speak English, if you need help booking
            taxis, please let us know and we can call for you. Taxis accept
            cards.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h4>Is there a dress code?</h4>
        <p>
          No, wear what you will feel comfortable in! For the Friday evening we
          will probably be fairly smart, but you don't need to be. On the
          Saturday think garden party—summer dresses, shirts and chinos.
          Hopefully it will be lovely and sunny, but it's worth bringing an
          extra layer as it may get cooler in the evening.
        </p>

        <h4>Is there a gift list?</h4>
        <p>
          No. Please do not bring us a gift, your being here is all we want! If
          you still really want to give something, please consider
          <a

            >donating to the Meadow House Hospice</a
          >, a charity very close to Caroline’s heart.
        </p>

        <h4>Covid restrictions</h4>
        <p>
          If you are arriving from overseas you currently need to fill in a
          <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.spth.gob.es/"
            >passenger locator form</a
          >. You must wear a mask on public transport, in taxis, and in
          healthcare settings (hospitals, pharmacies, <i>etc</i>).
        </p>

        <h4>Getting to/from the airport</h4>
        <p>
          A taxi to the centre from the airport will be around €30. The metro
          journey into the centre is slow but cheaper. You have to buy a special
          airport ticket which costs €5.15. The cheapest way of getting into the
          centre is using the Rodalies train. It only goes from Terminal 2 and
          there are two trains an hour into the centre.

          We are delighted that you are coming to celebrate with us and, for
          those of you who are travelling to Barcelona, we are so excited to
          host you in our home city. We're very happy to tailor recommendations

          by. Note that for most tourist attractions (<i>e.g.</i> Sagrada
          Familia) you will need to book well in advance. Here are some of our

        <h4>Bars</h4>
        <p>
          Again most of our favourites are in and around Gràcia, unless noted
          otherwise. Most of these places will do some food too. If you're a
          couple you'll probably be able to squeeze into most places, but if
          you're a bigger group you'll want to arrive fairly early (e.g. before
          8) or book (some below will take bookings) at least on weekends.
