				Web Technical Architect &#8193; 2014&ndash;2015
				<br>
				Web Developer &#8193; 2013&ndash;2014
			</h3>
			<p>graze.com</p>
		</header>
		<p>
			At graze I rapidly progressed from a relatively inexperienced web developer to become an authoritative voice both within the web team, and more broadly on architecture across the tech platform.
			I worked on everything from modernising and modularising front-end javascript to re-architecting the core web application. I also contributed significantly to the devolution of the first graze microservice&mdash;the product allocation system&mdash;and eventually took over as de facto lead developer on this service.
		</p>

		<aside>
			<p>
				Technologies at graze included PHP, mySQL, and AWS.
			</p>
			<p>
				Front-end tooling involved Gulp, Jasmine, and LESS.
			</p>
		</aside>
		<p>
			After 13 months I was promoted to web technical architect, with technical responsibility for the web product.
			In this role I drove forward projects to revamp the web architecture, including: rolling out a modern front-end framework; pushing for BDD and better testing; significantly improving app performance (time to first byte and server load); introducing up-to-date technologies for routing and templating.
			My final project at graze was to investigate and road map the separation of the existing monolithic architecture into a service-based architecture. This involved analysing a sprawling codebase powering a host of interacting applications, but also considering the interrelations of the different product teams, and the potential for areas of future business expansion.
		</p>

		<aside>
			During the winter and spring of 2013 I learnt Python (via the Django framework), HTML and CSS, and then PHP and mySQL.

			<h3>Research Developer &#8193; Feb&ndash;Apr 2013</h3>
			<p>www.microco.sm</p>
		</header>
		<p>
			I took an unpaid position with a start-up building a forum platform and as such was the first through the door besides the two founders.
			I was responsible for building an API-driven web application using the Django framework.
			Crucially I received extensive exposure to the process of starting a company, and the opportunity to learn first hand from two talented, senior developers.
		</p>

		<aside>
			<p>
				In 2012, I spent 5 months working in Greece as a windsurfing and sailing instructor for Mark Warner.
			</p>
			<p>
				Prior to this, I spent 10 weeks travelling through the Caribbean.

			<h3>Fine Art Quantitative Analyst &#8193; Apr&ndash;Dec 2011</h3>
			<p>Pierce Protocols Limited</p>
		</header>

		<p>
			My role was to report on the state and prognosis of the contemporary art market. In order to achieve this, I architected a rich relational database of artworks, owners, exhibitions and sales.
			With this I evolved statistical modelling techniques for artwork valuation and market performance which consistently forecasted auction prices more accurately than key market players.
		</p>

		<aside>
			After graduating in 2010 I worked as a yacht skipper in Croatia, before cycling solo from Ecuador to Patagonia.

				<p>Institute of Physics</p>

			<p>
				At various times I worked on publishing Supporting Physics Teaching materials online.
				This involved developing a Lua library for parsing custom TEX-based templates and generating both HTML and PDF editions from unified source material.
